## remapping

As a programmer, your keyboard is your main input method. As with pretty much anything in your computer, it is configurable (and worth configuring).

The most basic change is to remap keys.
This usually involves some software that is listening and, whenever a certain key is pressed, it intercepts that event and replaces it with another event corresponding to a different key. Some examples:
- Remap Caps Lock to Ctrl or Escape. We (the instructors) highly encourage this setting since Caps Lock has a very convenient location but is rarely used.
- Remapping PrtSc to Play/Pause music. Most OSes have a play/pause key.
- Swapping Ctrl and the Meta (Windows or Command) key.

You can also map keys to arbitrary commands of your choosing. This is useful for common tasks that you perform. Here, some software listens for a specific key combination and executes some script whenever that event is detected.
- Open a new terminal or browser window.
- Inserting some specific text, e.g. your long email address or your MIT ID number.
- Sleeping the computer or the displays.

There are even more complex modifications you can configure:
- Remapping sequences of keys, e.g. pressing shift five times toggles Caps Lock.
- Remapping on tap vs on hold, e.g. Caps Lock key is remapped to Esc if you quickly tap it, but is remapped to Ctrl if you hold it and use it as a modifier.
- Having remaps being keyboard or software specific.

Some software resources to get started on the topic:
- macOS - [karabiner-elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) or [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/)
- Linux - [xmodmap](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xmodmap) or [Autokey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey)
- Windows - Builtin in Control Panel, [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) or [SharpKeys](https://www.randyrants.com/category/sharpkeys/)
- QMK - If your keyboard supports custom firmware you can use [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm/) to configure the hardware device itself so the remaps works for any machine you use the keyboard with.
